# IP-Adapter for DiT Models

## Overview

This project aims to implement and adapt the IP-Adapter (Image Prompt Adapter) technique for Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models, with a particular focus on Lumina-Next-SFT. Our goal is to enhance text-to-image generation capabilities by incorporating image prompts into DiT-based architectures.

## Introduction

IP-Adapter is a technique that allows the integration of image prompts into text-to-image diffusion models. This project extends this concept to DiT models, starting with Lumina-Next-SFT. By doing so, we aim to improve the control and quality of generated images in DiT-based systems.

## Features

- IP-Adapter implementation compatible with DiT architectures
- Support for Lumina-Next-SFT as the initial target model
- Flexible design to accommodate various DiT-based models
- Training pipeline for fine-tuning IP-Adapter on custom datasets
- Evaluation tools to assess the quality and fidelity of generated images

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.9+
- Transformers library
- Diffusers library
- Accelerate library

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ip-adapter-dit.git
   cd ip-adapter-dit
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To train the IP-Adapter for Lumina-Next-SFT:

```
python train_ip_adapter.py --pretrained_model_name_or_path /path/to/lumina-next-sft \
                           --data_json_file /path/to/your/dataset.json \
                           --data_root_path /path/to/your/images \
                           --image_encoder_path /path/to/clip/image/encoder \
                           --output_dir ./output
```

For inference:

```
python inference.py --model_path ./output/best_model \
                    --prompt "A scenic landscape" \
                    --image_prompt /path/to/reference/image.jpg
```

## Model Architecture

Our IP-Adapter implementation for DiT models consists of:

1. A DiT-based backbone (e.g., Lumina-Next-SFT)
2. An image encoder (e.g., CLIP vision model)
3. A text encoder (e.g., Gemma-2b)
4. An IP-Adapter module that injects image information into the DiT's attention layers

[Include a diagram of the architecture if possible]

## Training

The training process involves:

1. Encoding input images and text prompts
2. Generating noisy latents
3. Predicting the noise using the IP-Adapter enhanced DiT model
4. Computing the loss and updating the model parameters

Detailed training configurations and hyperparameters can be found in `config.yaml`.

## Evaluation

We evaluate our model using:

- FID (Fr√©chet Inception Distance) for image quality
- CLIP score for text-image alignment
- Human evaluation for subjective quality assessment
